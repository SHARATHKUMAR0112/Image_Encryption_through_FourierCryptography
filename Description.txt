# Fourier-Based Image Encryption System with AI Integration

## Overview

An innovative, industrial-grade image encryption system that transforms images into encrypted Fourier coefficients, enabling visual reconstruction through mesmerizing epicycle animations. This system uniquely combines classical signal processing, modern cryptography, and AI-enhanced optimization to create a mathematically elegant yet cryptographically secure encryption approach.

## What Makes This Special?

Unlike traditional encryption that produces opaque binary data, this system:
- **Visualizes Encryption**: Watch your encrypted image reconstruct itself through rotating epicycles (like a mathematical spirograph)
- **Mathematically Beautiful**: Uses Discrete Fourier Transform to decompose images into frequency components
- **AI-Enhanced**: Intelligent optimization automatically determines the optimal number of coefficients for each image
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture supports post-quantum encryption and custom AI models
- **Production-Ready**: Military-grade AES-256 encryption with comprehensive security measures

## Core Innovation

The system encrypts images by:
1. **Edge Detection**: Extracts the essential contours from an image
2. **Fourier Decomposition**: Converts contours into rotating frequency components (epicycles)
3. **Coefficient Encryption**: Encrypts the Fourier coefficients with AES-256
4. **Visual Reconstruction**: Decryption animates the epicycles to redraw the original image

Think of it as encrypting the "DNA" of an image's shape, where each encrypted coefficient represents a rotating circle that, when combined, recreates the original drawing.
